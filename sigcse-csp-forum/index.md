## Overview
The CS Principles Providers and Teachers Forum is the inaugural gathering of CS Principles educators, providers and teachers in a structured session at SIGCSE. This forum was created to fill the need for a community for CS Principles providers and teachers to discuss best practices, feedback, or share teaching experiences.

The CS Principles Providers and Teachers Forum aims to increase collaboration and discussion among College Board endorsed providers and teachers by offering a diverse agenda. Topics that may be discussed this year include but are not limited to:

* Successes and failures of CSP professional development
* Common teaching issues providers and teachers encounter
* Teacher recruitment strategies and keeping in touch with teachers
* Student recruitment strategies
* Preparing for the AP CSP exam
* How to read the results of the AP CSP exam

## Logistics

The Forum is a half-day morning session, on **<time>Wednesday, February 21, 2018 from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM</time>**.

We will release the specific location closer to the date of the conference, but it will be somewhere at the Baltimore Convention Center with the rest of SIGCSE.

Breakfast and refreshments will be served.

## Topic Submissions

We are looking for topics that would be of broad interest to the CSP Community. We're hoping to keep presentations to a 15 minute limit to ensure there is time for discussion and questions. However, _please_ do not feel limited by the presentation format! We're open to ideas and suggestions.

_Presentation submissions have now closed. Thanks for your interest!_

## Agenda

The day will be organized as a series of short presentations, with ample time for discussion.
