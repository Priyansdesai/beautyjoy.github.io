## Overview
The 2019 CS Principles Providers and Teachers Forum is the second gathering of CS Principles educators, providers and teachers in a structured session at SIGCSE. This forum was created to fill the need for a community for CS Principles providers and teachers to discuss best practices, feedback, or share teaching experiences.

The CS Principles Providers and Teachers Forum aims to increase collaboration and discussion among College Board endorsed providers and teachers by offering a diverse agenda. Topics that may be discussed this year include but are not limited to:

* Successes and failures of CSP professional development
* Common teaching issues providers and teachers encounter
* Teacher recruitment strategies and keeping in touch with teachers
* Student recruitment strategies
* Preparing for the AP CSP exam
* How to read the results of the AP CSP exam
