<h3>The Beauty and Joy of Computing</h3>

<p>Computing has changed the world in profound ways. It
    has opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research,
    play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a
    small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience
    comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into
    code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using <a
            href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap<em>!</em></a> (based on <a
            href="http://www.scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>), one of the friendliest
    programming languages ever invented. It&#39;s purely graphical, which means
    programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks
    out of smaller blocks. </p>

<p>But this course is far more than just learning to program.
    We focus on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing, such as abstraction,
    design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the limits of computation.
    We show some beautiful applications of computing that have changed the
    world, talk about the history of computing, and where it will go in the
    future. Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the
    student and to society. As an example, the final project is completely of
    the students&#39; choosing, on a topic most interesting to them. The
    overarching theme is to expose students to the beauty and joy of computing.
    We are especially excited
    about bringing computing (through this course) to traditionally
    under-represented groups in computing, i.e., women and ethnic minorities.
