<h3>About BJC and This Workshop</h3>

<p>BJC is designed to meet the
    requirements of the College Board AP Computer Science Principles curriculum
    framework.  It was originally developed as a university breadth course at
    the University of California, Berkeley, and has been extensively revised for
    high school use at EDC (Education Development Center).</p>

<p>This is a six-week workshop. The first and last weeks are face-to-face; during the middle four weeks, most of the
    work is done online, along with a computer-mediated virtual meeting once per week. The materials needed for the
    workshop are all online, with links to them on this page.</p>
