<h3>About BJC and this Workshop</h3>

<p>
    BJC, or The Beauty and Joy of Computing, is an AP Computer Science Principles curriculum that emphasizes the joy and
    complexity of creating visual computer programs and apps, balanced with critical reflection on both the potential
    benefits and harms of new computing technologies. The Beauty and Joy of Computing adheres to the College Board's new
    <a href="https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles" target="_blank">
        AP Computer Science Principles
    </a>
    course requirements.
</p>

<p>
    BJC has a strong design and programming focus, using the visual programming language Snap<em>!</em> and a collaborative, exploratory approach where students work in teams to bring their own unique creations to life.
</p>

<p>
    BJC is culturally situated, presenting programming and computing ideas not in isolation, but in the context of how students interact with computers in their daily lives. In our readings and discussions, we critically explore how technology has changed the world for better, and for worse, enabling students to understand the potential benefits and harms of creating new things with computing. Student readings are taken mainly from the companion book Blown to Bits, which is available for free online download.
</p>

<p>
    BJC is designed to meet the requirements of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ap-cs-principles">College Board AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework</a>. It was originally developed as a university breadth course at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been extensively revised for high school use at EDC (Education Development Center).
</p>

<p>
    This is a three-week workshop. The middle week is face-to-face; during the first and last weeks, most of the work is done online, along with a computer-mediated virtual meeting once per week. The materials needed for the workshop are all online, with links to them on this page.
