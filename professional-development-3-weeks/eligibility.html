<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Certified high school teachers, college faculty, and supporters.</strong> The BJC CSP PD course is open to all certified high school teachers in the USA who successfully complete the application process. It is also open to others that support these teachers.</li>
    <li><strong>Teachers of all disciplines and backgrounds.</strong> The BJC CSP PD is open to teachers in all disciplines. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines are especially encouraged to apply. No prior computer science knowledge or computer programming experience is required, however.</li>
    <li><strong>Principal's consent.</strong> An important criterion of eligibility for teachers interested in the PD course is an agreement from the teacher's principal that the AP BJC CSP course will be offered in the teacher's school during the 2017-2018 academic year and, if possible, the 2016-2017 academic year. The <a href="http://bit.ly/2016-BJC-Principal-form">BJC Principal Approval Form</a> also includes acknowledgement of and agreement to collect student research data. (Because one of our primary goals is to broaden participation in computing, we will accept applications from schools that wish to offer the BJC CSP course as a non-AP course.)</li>

<p>If you are an <strong>international teacher</strong>, we welcome you to join us at one of our PD sessions, but we and DonorsChoose.org unfortunately cannot provide any monetary support. You will be responsible for the full price of the PD, and you will need to arrange travel, visas, etc. on your own. If you are still interested in joining us this summer, please complete only the “All Teachers”  section of the application process below! If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:contact@bjc.berkeley.edu">contact@bjc.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a <strong>private school teacher</strong>, we will offer the PD to you at a discounted cost, and you are eligible to receive up to $1000 for providing the project with data from your course. (You will not be eligible for a summer stipend). STOP READING this section and complete only the “All Teachers” section of the application process below!</p>

<p>If you are a <strong>public school teacher</strong>, your costs will be paid through DonorsChoose, two ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The No Stipend Model - As a teacher, you or your school district would need to raise $1,000 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by InfoSys to reach the $2,000 cost of professional development. You must teach BJC this upcoming academic year per the agreement with your school principal and commit to taking our BJC surveys throughout the year. See our <a href="http://bjc.link/pd16costbreakdown">cost breakdown here</a>.</li>
    <li>The Full Stipend Model - As a teacher, you or your school district would need to raise $2,000 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by InfoSys to reach the $4,000 cost of professional development ($2,000 to fund the cost of your professional development and $2,000 in stipends for yourself). You will receive $1,000 after finishing the first part of our online PD and our face-to-face PD. You will receive an additional $1,000 after you have taught BJC this upcoming academic year and have submitted all required materials to us. See our <a href="http://bjc.link/pd16costbreakdown">cost breakdown here</a>.</li>
</ol>
