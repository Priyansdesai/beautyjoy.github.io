The Beauty and Joy of Computing is an AP Computer Science Principles compliant curriculum. Our syllabus (see below) has been approved by the College Board for the 2017-2018 Academic Year.

From [the College Board CSP site](https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles):

> AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. With a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications, AP Computer Science Principles prepares students for college and career.
> 
> **Computer Science: The New Literacy**
> 
> Whether it's 3-D animation, engineering, music, app development, medicine, visual design, robotics, or political analysis, computer science is the engine that powers the technology, productivity, and innovation that drive the world. Computer science experience has become an imperative for today's students and the workforce of tomorrow.
> 
> The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.
> 
> **Rigorously Developed**
> 
> In development since 2008, AP Computer Science Principles was created with significant support from the National Science Foundation. The College Board worked with more than 50 leading high school and higher education computer science educators who piloted the course at their institutions. This rigorous process of development and testing has yielded a course that not only reflects the latest scholarship in the field, but provides students with a relevant and engaging learning experience.
> 
> Over 90 colleges and universities have stated their support for the course, with the majority anticipating they will award college credit for high exam scores.

    (Excerpt: "All students should have equitable access to this new course. Care should be taken to ensure that students taking the course are demographically representative of the school's population before confirming their enrollment. Therefore, we encourage you to create policies that promote and enable diversity in the course and to not create barriers that would discourage underrepresented groups from participating.")
