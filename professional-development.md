### What is BJC?

BJC, or The Beauty and Joy of Computing, is an AP Computer Science Principles curriculum that emphasizes the joy and complexity of creating visual computer programs and apps, balanced with critical reflection on both the potential benefits and harms of new computing technologies. Beauty and Joy of Computing adheres to the College Board's new [AP Computer Science Principles](https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles) course requirements.

BJC has a strong design and programming focus, using the visual programming language Snap! and a collaborative, exploratory approach where students work in teams to bring their own unique creations to life.

BJC is culturally situated, presenting programming and computing ideas not in isolation, but in the context of how students interact with computers in their daily lives. In our readings and discussions, we critically explore how technology has changed the world for better, and for worse, enabling students to understand the potential benefits and harms of creating new things with computing. Student readings are taken mainly from the companion book Blown to Bits, which is available for free online download.

The BJC project homepage is <bjc.berkeley.edu> and the newest curriculum is at <bjc.edc.org>.

### Why choose BJC?

* BJC teaches strong fundamental concepts of programming
    * In BJC students use Snap!, an accessible but full-featured block-based programming language, to explore concepts ranging from loops and variables up through recursion and higher-order functions.
* BJC focuses on collaboration
    * In BJC, students are encouraged to work in small groups, using pair programming for projects, and collaborating online to answer each others’ questions.
* BJC assignments foster creativity & design thinking
    * BJC includes project-centric labs, where groups are encouraged to build and design their own games, applications, and more. See some examples here!
* BJC situates computing in the real world
    * BJC units explore how computing is used in real-world applications, from Google Search algorithms to Big Data to today’s news.
* BJC emphasizes that computing is for everyone, and is a matter of equity
    * Computing is a vital skill in the 21st century; everyone needs to have input into new computing innovations. BJC emphasizes equity and engages students and teachers in discussing how we can promote it.
* BJC is well-supported
    * BJC teachers attend face-to-face professional development programs and have access to a wealth of online resources, including a repository of shared course materials, weekly group calls, and personalized support via edX SPOCs (small, personalized online courses that provide a management system for your BJC course)

If you are an __international teacher__, we welcome you to join us at one of our PD sessions, but we and DonorsChoose.org unfortunately cannot provide any monetary support. You will be responsible for the full price of the PD, and you will need to arrange travel, visas, etc. on your own. If you are still interested in joining us this summer, please complete only the “All Teachers”  section of the application process below! If you have any questions, please email <contact@bjc.berkeley.edu>.

If you are a __private school teacher__, we will offer the PD to you at a discounted cost, and you are eligible to receive up to $1000 for providing the project with data from your course. (You will not be eligible for a summer stipend). STOP READING this section and complete only the “All Teachers” section of the application process below!

If you are a __public school teacher__, your costs will be paid through DonorsChoose, two ways:
1. The No Stipend Model - As a teacher, you or your school district would need to raise $1,000 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by InfoSys to reach the $2,000 cost of professional development. You must teach BJC this upcoming academic year per the agreement with your school principal and commit to taking our BJC surveys throughout the year. See our [cost breakdown here](http://bjc.link/pd16costbreakdown).
2. The Full Stipend Model - As a teacher, you or your school district would need to raise $2,000 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by InfoSys to reach the $4,000 cost of professional development ($2,000 to fund the cost of your professional development and $2,000 in stipends for yourself). You will receive $1,000 after finishing the first part of our online PD and our face-to-face PD. You will receive an additional $1,000 after you have taught BJC this upcoming academic year and have submitted all required materials to us. See our [cost breakdown here](http://bjc.link/pd16costbreakdown).

You should __complete the BJC application__ _before_ you raise the funds. The fundraising process is being organized by DonorsChoose.org, which provides a mechanism by which donors can pledge funds to support you.
