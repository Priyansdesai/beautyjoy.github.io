To update the bjc.berkeley.edu website

1) make changes in the github repo beautyjoy/BJC_Website
2) in /website-repo, do a 'git pull'.  You may need to 
   put /usr/sww/bin/git on your path, and you may need to 
   "export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true" first.  Also note, git
   seems to have problems on apps.eecs, but usually works
   on login.eecs
3) run /website-repo/push, which copies files into the right
   places
4) contact brian harvey if there is a problem!
