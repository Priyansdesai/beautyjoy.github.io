        <p class="lead text-center"><strong>The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)</strong> is an introductory computer
          science curriculum developed at the University of California, Berkeley,
          intended for non-CS majors at the high school junior through undergraduate
          freshman level.  It was one of the five initial pilot programs for the
          <a href="http://csprinciples.org">AP CS Principles</a> course being
          developed by the College Board and the National Science Foundation.
          We offer it as <a href="http://cs10.org/">CS 10</a> at Berkeley.</p>

        <h3>Professional Development</h3>
        <p>
          We offer a six-week summer professional development workshop for teachers intending to teach BJC the following year.  In this workshop, the first and last weeks are held face-to-face; the middle four weeks consist mostly of online lab materials, with weekly computer-mediated discussion sessions. <b>We've finished our Summer 2014 PD; check back here in late fall for information about Summer 2015 PD opportunities.</b>

        <h3>Snap! Programming Language</h3>
        <p><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap<em>!</em></a> (formerly BYOB) is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language.  It is an extended reimplementation of <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> (a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks. It also features first class lists, first class procedures, and continuations.  These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.</p>

        <h3>Textbook on Social Implications</h3>
        <p>In the non-programming part of our course we try to balance a fundamental optimism about the future of computer technology with an understanding of its limitations and potential for harm. Student readings are taken mainly from the excellent textbook <a href="http://bitsbook.com/"><i>Blown to Bits,</i></a> which is available for free online download.</p>
