  - name: Snap<em>!</em> Desktop Application

      Two ways to do this:

      1. Run Snap*!*, click on the Snap*!* logo at the top left, and choose "download source."  This will put a folder in your downloads folder with just the HTML and Javascript needed to run Snap*!* minimally, with no libraries, costumes, help screens, etc.
      2. The complete git repository for Snap*!* is at: <https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks>. We recommend finding a git expert to help with downloading it if you are unfamiliar with git.

      This is good to use when internet connection is intermittent in the short term. However in the long term, this is not a recommended practice because this standalone version will not automatically update whenever our Snap*!* developers push updates.

      Two ways to do this:

      1. Turn your project into a desktop app by making an XML file (using the "export project" menu option) and then loading it into: <http://snapp.citilab.eu/>
      2. A simple tool to embed a Snap*!* XML project into a stand-alone HTML page. Export the project from Snap*!* and the upload it here: <http://arena.csc.ncsu.edu/snap/converter/>. The file it creates is HTML, and it requires an internet connection, but it is self-executing. Created by Thomas Price, NCSU PhD student.
