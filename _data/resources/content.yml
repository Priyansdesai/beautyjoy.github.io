      SPOC stands for small private online course. We currently offer BJC to the world on edX (edx.org), and this SPOC allows for customization of that version of BJC to fit specific classroom needs, primarily branding and content scheduling.

      The SPOC has BJC’s most recent lab content, readings, quizzes, discussions, lecture videos, autograded lab exercises, projects, AP Performance Tasks (Create and Explore), and capstone exams.

      BJC.12x is ready August 2016 -- this contains content from Units 1, 2, 3 and 4. BJC.34x will be ready November 2016 and will contain content form Units 5, 6, and 7.

      If you'd like access, please:
