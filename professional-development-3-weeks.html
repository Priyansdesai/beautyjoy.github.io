<p>This workshop begins with an online component.  <i>It's really important
    that you complete this work before the face-to-face session!</i>  Similarly,
    there is a significant amount of important work online following the
    face-to-face week.</p>

<p>If you have trouble doing this work, whether it's a problem getting online
    or a problem understanding the units, don't just give up.  Instead, use our
    Piazza group (see week 1 below) to ask for help, or if that fails, push this
    <b><a href="mailto:contact@bjc.berkeley.edu">panic button</a></b> to send
    us an email.</p>
