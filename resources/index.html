          <div class="row-fluid">
<p>We are pleased to announce that the National Science Foundation has awarded
a four-year grant (calendar years 2015-2018) to a partnership of four organizations that will create new
BJC curriculum materials and bring them to 100 New York public high school
teachers.</p>

<p>The partners are
<ul><li>University of California, Berkeley
(<a href="http://berkeley.edu">UCB</a>)</li>
<li>Education Development Center
(<a href="http://edc.org">EDC</a>)</li>
<li>New York City Department of Education
(<a href="http://schools.nyc.gov">NYCDOE</a>)</li>
<li>New York City Foundation for Computer Science Education
(<a href="http://csnyc.org">CSNYC</a>)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>High school teachers we've worked with so far have asked us for more
K-12-friendly curriculum materials, including a teacher's manual, scope and
sequence, and lesson plans.  EDC, a very experienced nonprofit developer of
K-12 curricula, will work with UCB to create a complete new curriculum package
while maintaining the BJC spirit of technical rigor, connection with real
applications, and student-initiated projects.</p>

<p>UCB will lead three summer workshops in New York; NYCDOE will recruit and
select 100 high school teachers to attend those workshops, serving a wide
range of students representing all ethnic groups and all levels of academic
success.  Some of the teachers from the first workshop will help lead later
workshops, so that the preparation of BJC teachers can continue after the
project is over.</p>

<p>CSNYC is a nonprofit foundation that has played a leading role in getting
computer science education into New York at all levels.  Their role in this
project will be to organize support and community-building for the BJC
teachers during the school year.  (UCB and EDC will also participate in
school-year activities, including observation of BJC classes to inform a
second round of curriculum development.)</p>

<p>We're very excited about this new opportunity to have a major BJC impact on
an entire city!  We are also still seeking funding to continue BJC workshops
outside New York during these years.</p>
