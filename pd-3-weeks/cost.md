### Cost, Stipends and Support

*   **Summer PD Stipend:** Accepted public school teachers funded through DonorsChoose.org will be eligible for a $1,000 stipend for successful completion of all teacher requirements for the BJC Summer PD.

*   **Classroom Support:** Will be provided by mentors throughout the school year, through an online platform and the use of recorded lessons.

*   **Access to a support network:** Teachers will have access to online forums and an e-mail group to share ideas and materials with other BJC CSP teachers and mentors.

If you are a **private school or international teacher**, we welcome you to join us at one of our PD sessions, however we and DonorsChoose.org unfortunately cannot provide any monetary support. You will be responsible for the full price of the PD, and you will need to arrange travel, visas, etc. on your own. If you are still interested in joining us this summer, please complete _only_ the “All Teachers” section of the application process below! If you have any questions, please email pd@bjc.berkeley.edu.

If you are a **public school teacher**, your costs will be paid through DonorsChoose.org, two ways:

*   **The No Stipend Model**: As a teacher, you or your school district need to raise $1,000 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by the Infosys Foundation to reach the $2,000 cost of professional development. You must teach BJC this upcoming academic year per the agreement with your school principal and commit to taking our BJC surveys throughout the year. See our [cost breakdown here](http://bjc.link/2017_cost_breakdown).

*   **The Full Stipend Model**: As a teacher, you or your school district need to raise $1,500 on DonorsChoose.org to fund the cost of your professional development. Every dollar you raise will be matched by the Infosys Foundation to reach the total cost of $3,000 for professional development ($2,000 to fund the cost of your professional development and a $1,000 in stipend for yourself). You will receive $1,000 after successful completion of all teacher requirements for the BJC summer PD. See our [cost breakdown here](http://bjc.link/2017_cost_breakdown).

You should [**complete the BJC application**]({{sitebase.url}}/pd-3-weeks/apply) _before_ you raise the funds. The fundraising process is being organized by DonorsChoose.org, which provides a mechanism by which donors can pledge funds to support you.
