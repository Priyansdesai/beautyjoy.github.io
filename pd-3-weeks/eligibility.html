<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Certified high school teachers, college faculty, and supporters.</strong> The BJC CSP PD course is open to all certified high school teachers in the USA who successfully complete the application process. It is also open to others that support these teachers.</li>
    <li><strong>Teachers of all disciplines and backgrounds.</strong> The BJC CSP PD is open to teachers in all disciplines. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines are especially encouraged to apply. No prior computer science knowledge or computer programming experience is required.</li>
    <li><strong>Principal's consent.</strong> An important criterion of eligibility for teachers interested in the PD course is an agreement from the teacher's principal that the AP BJC CSP course will be offered in the teacher's school during the 2018-2019 academic year and, if possible, the 2017-2018 academic year. The <a href="http://bjc.link/2017_principles_form">BJC Principal Approval Form</a> also includes acknowledgement of and agreement to collect student research data. (Because one of our primary goals is to broaden participation in computing, we will accept applications from schools that wish to offer the BJC CSP course as a non-AP course.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Project will Provide to Participating Teachers and Schools</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Professional Development.</strong> A 3-week professional development (PD) course.</li>
    <li><strong>Pedagogical Resources.</strong> Lesson plans, rubrics, assessments, permission forms and other resources needed to teach the AP BJC CSP course.</li>
    <li><strong>Community.</strong> A community consisting of project leaders and mentor teachers who will provide support throughout the school year.</li>
