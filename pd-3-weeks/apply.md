**Tips and Advice for Fundraising!** We’re compiling success stories of fully funded teachers to provide insight into the process. Please definitely read this as it will help in your fundraising and navigating DC.org. Many teachers are having their projects funded in 7 days!

**Please have all three parts completed 6 weeks in advance of your desired PD location so that you give yourself enough time to fundraise.**
