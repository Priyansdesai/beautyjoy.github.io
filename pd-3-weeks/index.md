### About BJC and this Workshop

BJC, The Beauty and Joy of Computing, is an AP Computer Science Principles curriculum that emphasizes the joy and complexity of creating visual computer programs and apps, balanced with critical reflection on both the potential benefits and harms of new computing technologies. The Beauty and Joy of Computing adheres to the College Board's new [AP Computer Science Principles](https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles) course requirements.

BJC has a strong design and programming focus, using the visual programming language Snap<em>!</em> and a collaborative, exploratory approach where students work in teams to bring their own unique creations to life.

BJC is culturally situated, presenting programming and computing ideas not in isolation, but in the context of how students interact with computers in their daily lives. In our readings and discussions, we critically explore how technology has changed the world for better, and for worse, enabling students to understand the potential benefits and harms of creating new things with computing. Student readings are taken mainly from the companion book Blown to Bits, which is available for free online download.

BJC is designed to meet the requirements of the [College Board AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/ap-cs-principles). It was originally developed as a university breadth course at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been extensively revised for high school use at EDC (Education Development Center).

The newest curriculum is at [bjc.edc.org](http://bjc.edc.org).

### Why choose BJC?

*   BJC teaches strong fundamental concepts of programming.
    *   In BJC students use Snap<em>!</em>, an accessible but full-featured block-based programming language, to explore concepts ranging from loops and variables up through recursion and higher-order functions.
*   BJC focuses on collaboration.
    *   In BJC, students are encouraged to work in small groups, using pair programming for projects, and collaborating online to answer each others' questions.
*   BJC assignments foster creativity and design thinking.
    *   BJC includes project-centric labs, where groups are encouraged to build and design their own games, applications, and more. See [Snap<em>!</em> examples](http://snap.berkeley.edu)!
*   BJC situates computing in the real world.
    *   BJC units explore how computing is used in real-world applications, from Google Search algorithms to Big Data to today's news.
*   BJC emphasizes that computing is for everyone, and is a matter of equity.
    *   Computing is a vital skill in the 21st century; everyone needs to have input into new computing innovations. BJC emphasizes equity and engages students and teachers in discussing how we can promote it.
*   BJC is well-supported.
    *   BJC teachers attend face-to-face professional development programs and have access to a wealth of online resources, including a repository of shared course materials, weekly group calls, and personalized support via edX SPOCs (small, personalized online courses that provide a management system for your BJC course).

### Who is teaching BJC?

The Beauty and Joy of Computing is taught across the country, with over 250 teachers from 41 states applying to attend our teacher preparation workshops. Teachers are also using our curriculum in Canada, Ireland, Guam, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia, Senegal, Cape Verde, Nepal, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Germany.

### How can I be part of BJC PD?

We offer a summer professional development workshop for teachers intending to teach BJC the following year. In this workshop, one week in the middle is held face-to-face; the other weeks consist of online lab materials, computer-mediated discussion sessions, and weekly videos from our project leads.

Please complete our [2018 PD Interest Form](http://bit.ly/pdinterest18) to receive updates. We will be confirming our 2018 dates and locations soon.

### How much does it cost?

The traditional BJC Summer PD is offered at potentially NO cost for U.S. public school teachers; these teachers use the DonorsChoose model to raise the tuition. Private school teachers must pay $2,000 for the PD.

### Where is BJC PD being offered?

We will be updating locations for 2018 in the coming months.
