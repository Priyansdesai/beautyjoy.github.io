### Eligibility

*   **Certified high school teachers, college faculty, and supporters.** The BJC CSP PD course is open to all certified high school teachers in the USA who successfully complete the application process. It is also open to others that support these teachers.
*   **Teachers of all disciplines and backgrounds.** The BJC CSP PD is open to teachers in all disciplines. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines are especially encouraged to apply. No prior computer science knowledge or computer programming experience is required.
*   **Principal's consent.** An important criterion of eligibility for teachers interested in the PD course is an agreement from the teacher's principal that the AP BJC CSP course will be offered in the teacher's school during the 2018-2019 academic year and, if possible, the 2017-2018 academic year. The [BJC Principal Approval Form](http://bjc.link/2017_principles_form) also includes acknowledgement of and agreement to collect student research data. (Because one of our primary goals is to broaden participation in computing, we will accept applications from schools that wish to offer the BJC CSP course as a non-AP course.)

### What the Project will Provide to Participating Teachers and Schools

*   **Professional Development.** A 3-week professional development (PD) course.
*   **Pedagogical Resources.** Lesson plans, rubrics, assessments, permission forms and other resources needed to teach the AP BJC CSP course.
*   **Community.** A community consisting of project leaders and mentor teachers who will provide support throughout the school year.
*   **Stipend.** Teachers accepted for the PD will receive a stipend for the PD.

### What is Expected of the Teacher During the Summer

*   Complete the three week PD course, approximately 60 hours (15-20 hours pre-PD preparation, 40 hours Week 2 face-to-face, ~5 hours post-PD).
*   Work through a selection of the course's 7 content units. The units are exactly those that students will do.
*   Maintain an online portfolio of the work on the lessons.

### What is Expected of the Teacher During the School Year

*   Teach the BJC CSP course, ideally over the course of the entire academic year, but half-year courses can also work (in cases of block scheduling).
*   Work with the project research team to gather data from students (student and parental consent forms, a pre- and post-course questionnaire, completed rubrics for the student performance tasks, final exam, etc.)
*   _Please consult your administrator or district assessment coordinator to confirm participation in the research portion of the project. Copies of questionnaires and consent forms are available upon request to [tiffany.barnes@gmail.com](mailto:tiffany.barnes@gmail.com)_
*   Participate in periodic online hangouts with project leaders and mentor teachers.
*   Participate (optionally) in the CS10K Community of Practice and/or the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA).
*   Complete a teacher survey at the end of the academic year.

### What is Expected of the Teacher's School

*   Schedule at least one section of the BJC CSP course during the 2017-2018 academic calendar year and, if possible, in the 2018-2019 calendar year and, if possible, in the 2017-2018 calendar year.
*   Recruit an appropriate number of students of the targeted demographic (females, minority students and disabled students).
