<p>
    For research purposes, this site uses Google Analytics to collect
    aggregate information about, e.g., how often the site is used and what links are
    followed from it.  We do not collect personally identifiable information,
    but if you have a Gmail account or have ever Googled yourself from your
    own computer, then, despite their assurances to the contrary, <b>Google does
    collect such information.</b>  We recommend that you use
    <a href="http://adblockplus.org">AdBlock Plus</a>,
    <a href="http://ghostery.com">Ghostery</a>,
    <a href="http://noscript.org">NoScript</a>, and/or
    <a href="http://privoxy.org">Privoxy</a> to protect your browsing privacy.
    The first two are really easy to install and use; the last two take a bit
    more effort to whitelist sites you trust.
    (You might also consider the tracking-free
    <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine.)

    We do collect your IP address.  If you have a fixed IP address, this
    <i>is</i> personally identifying information.  (If you don't know what a
    "fixed IP address" is, this almost certainly doesn't apply to you.)
