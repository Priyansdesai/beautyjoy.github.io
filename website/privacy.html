<tr><th>Privacy Policy
<tr><td>For research purposes, this site uses Google Analytics to collect
aggregate information about, e.g., how often the site is used and what links are
followed from it.  We do not collect personally identifiable information,
but if you have a Gmail account or have ever Googled yourself from your
own computer, then, despite their assurances to the contrary, <b>Google does
collect such information.</b>  We recommend that you use
<a href="http://adblockplus.org">AdBlock Plus</a>,
<a href="http://ghostery.com">Ghostery</a>,
<a href="http://noscript.org">NoScript</a>, and/or
<a href="http://privoxy.org">Privoxy</a> to protect your browsing privacy.
The first two are really easy to install and use; the last two take a bit
more effort to whitelist sites you trust.
